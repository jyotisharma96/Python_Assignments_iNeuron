    "Answer- In Python 3.x, strings are represented by the str object type. The str class provides various built-in functions and methods to manipulate and operate on strings. Here are some commonly used functions and methods of the str object:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. len(str): Returns the length of the string.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "2. str.capitalize(): Returns a copy of the string with its first character capitalized and the rest lowercased.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "3. str.lower(): Returns a copy of the string converted to lowercase.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "4. str.upper(): Returns a copy of the string converted to uppercase.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "5. str.title(): Returns a copy of the string with the first character of each word capitalized.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "6. str.strip(): Returns a copy of the string with leading and trailing whitespace removed.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "7. str.split(sep=None, maxsplit=-1): Returns a list of substrings obtained by splitting the string at each occurrence of the separator sep.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "8. str.join(iterable): Concatenates the elements of an iterable (e.g., a list) using the string as a separator.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "9. str.startswith(prefix): Returns True if the string starts with the specified prefix, otherwise False.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "10. str.endswith(suffix): Returns True if the string ends with the specified suffix, otherwise False.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "11. str.replace(old, new): Returns a copy of the string with all occurrences of the substring old replaced by new.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "12. str.find(sub): Returns the lowest index in the string where the substring sub is found, or -1 if it is not present.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "13. str.count(sub): Returns the number of non-overlapping occurrences of the substring sub in the string.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "14. str.isnumeric(): Returns True if all characters in the string are numeric, otherwise False.\n",

    "Answer- Python supports ASCII as a subset of Unicode. The default encoding of characters in Python is UTF-8 (Unicode Transformation Format - 8-bit).ASCII is really a 7-bit character set; it is mapped to 8-bit bytes by setting the high bit to zero. Thus, ASCII characters are unchanged in UTF-8. A non-zero high bit indicates that a character composed of multiple bytes."

    "Text Mode:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Text mode is the default mode for file operations in Python.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Text mode treats the data in the file as a sequence of Unicode characters.\n",

    "\n",
    "4. When writing to a text file, Python encodes the Unicode characters into bytes using the default encoding.\n",
    "\n",
    "5. In text mode, newline characters ('\\n') are automatically converted to the platform-specific newline representation (e.g., '\\r\\n' on Windows).\n",
    "\n",
    "6. Text mode allows you to work with text files and provides convenient operations for string manipulation and line-based processing.\n",
    "\n",
    "Binary Mode:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Binary mode treats the data in the file as a sequence of bytes.\n",
    "2. In binary mode, data is read and written exactly as it is without any encoding or decoding.\n",
    "3. When reading from a binary file, you get the raw bytes from the file.\n",
    "4. When writing to a binary file, you can write bytes directly without any encoding.\n",
    "5. In binary mode, newline characters are not automatically converted, and they are read and written as-is.\n",
    "6. Binary mode is useful when working with non-text files such as images, audio files, or binary data that should not undergo any character encoding or decoding.\n",
    "\n",
    "To specify the mode when opening a file, you can use the open() function and specify the desired mode as the second argument. For example:"
