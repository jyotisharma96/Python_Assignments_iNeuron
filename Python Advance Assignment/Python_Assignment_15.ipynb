    "Answer- Python 3.8 introduced several new features and improvements. Some of the key features added in Python 3.8 are:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Assignment Expressions (the Walrus Operator): Python 3.8 introduced the : = operator, also known as the \"walrus operator.\" It allows you to assign values to variables as part of an expression. This feature is particularly useful in conditional statements and while-loop conditions.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Positional-Only Parameters: Python 3.8 introduced the ability to define function parameters as \"positional-only,\" using the / separator. This allows you to enforce that certain arguments must be passed positionally and cannot be passed as keyword arguments.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "3. f-strings = faster: Python 3.8 optimized the performance of f-strings, making them significantly faster than before. This improvement enhances the speed of string formatting operations.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "4. Improved Syntax Warnings: Python 3.8 introduced more informative and helpful syntax warnings. These warnings provide better insights into potential syntax errors or deprecated features, assisting developers in writing cleaner and more maintainable code.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "5. New Syntax for Type Hints: Python 3.8 introduced the TypedDict type hint, which allows you to define dictionaries with specific key-value types. It also introduced the Literal type hint, which allows you to specify a literal value as a type.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "6. Parallel File System Cache for import: In Python 3.8, the import system was improved to utilize a parallel file system cache. This enhances the performance of importing modules, particularly in scenarios with many modules or large codebases.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "7. Syntax for Type Hinting Generics: Python 3.8 introduced improved syntax for type hinting generics, making it easier to work with generic types and collections.\n"

    "Answer- Monkey patching in Python refers to the practice of modifying or extending the behavior of an existing module, class, or object at runtime, without altering its original source code. It allows you to add, replace, or modify attributes, methods, or functionality dynamically.\n",

    "In this example, we have a class MyClass with an original_method. We then define a new function new_method and assign it as an attribute to the class MyClass at runtime using monkey patching. As a result, instances of MyClass gain access to the newly added new_method, even though it was not defined in the original class.\n",
    "\n",
    "Monkey patching can be useful in certain situations, such as adding functionality to existing classes or fixing issues in third-party libraries without modifying their source code. However, it is important to use monkey patching judiciously, as it can make code harder to understand, maintain, and debug if misused."

In other words, it creates a new object, but the nested objects themselves are not copied. Changes made to the nested objects in the copy will also be reflected in the original object and vice versa. Shallow copy is the default behavior for most Python objects."
