    "The purpose of Python's object-oriented programming (OOP) is to provide a powerful and flexible programming paradigm for organizing and structuring code. OOP allows you to design and implement complex systems by representing real-world objects, their properties, and their interactions through the use of classes and objects. Here are some key purposes and benefits of OOP in Python:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. OOP promotes modularity by encapsulating related data and functionality into objects. Objects can be created based on reusable classes, allowing you to create instances with similar behavior and attributes. This modularity and reusability make it easier to build and maintain large codebases and encourages code organization.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "2. OOP allows you to create abstract models that hide complex implementation details. Classes encapsulate data (attributes) and operations (methods) into a single unit, providing a clean interface for interacting with objects. Encapsulation protects data from direct access, ensuring that it is accessed and modified through controlled interfaces, enhancing code security and maintainability.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "3. Inheritance allows you to create new classes (derived or child classes) based on existing classes (base or parent classes), inheriting their attributes and methods. This promotes code reuse and helps to establish an \"is-a\" relationship between objects. Polymorphism allows objects of different classes to be treated uniformly, providing flexibility and extensibility.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "4. OOP enables you to structure code into logical units (classes and objects), making it easier to understand, navigate, and maintain. By dividing functionality into separate classes, each responsible for a specific task, you can achieve better organization, separation of concerns, and improved readability.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "5. OOP facilitates collaboration among developers working on the same project. By defining classes and their interfaces, different team members can work on different components independently and integrate them seamlessly later. OOP also enables code libraries and frameworks to be developed, providing reusable components for other developers to utilize.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "6. OOP allows for flexible and extensible code through mechanisms like inheritance and polymorphism. You can easily extend existing classes to create new ones or modify their behavior without affecting the rest of the codebase. This flexibility enables code adaptability to changing requirements and promotes code evolution.\n"

    "Answer- When a program tries to access an attribute of an object in Python, the inheritance search looks for the attribute in the following order:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. The instance itself: If the attribute is directly defined in the instance (object), it will be found and used immediately. The search stops at this point.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "2. The instance's class: If the attribute is not found in the instance, Python looks for the attribute in the class of the instance. This includes both instance variables and class variables. If found, it is used, and the search stops.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "3. Parent classes and their ancestors: If the attribute is not found in the instance or its class, Python continues the search in the parent classes and their ancestors in the order they are defined. This process continues until the attribute is found or until the search exhausts all available classes in the inheritance hierarchy.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "This search order is often referred to as the \"Method Resolution Order\" (MRO), and it follows a depth-first, left-to-right approach. It ensures that attributes are inherited and overridden correctly in the presence of multiple inheritan"

    "Answer- Objects and Instances are almost similar and are often used interchangeably but with a small difference. Object is a generic term , it is physically present but remains undiferrentiated. Instance is something that gives them a separate identity.\n",

By convention, the first parameter of any instance method should always be self, although it is not a reserved keyword in Python.\n",
