    "Answer- Multiple inheritance refers to the ability of a class to inherit attributes and behaviors from more than one parent class. In other words, a class can derive characteristics and features from multiple source classes simultaneously.\n",
    "\n",
    "When a class inherits from multiple parent classes, it combines the properties and methods of all the parent classes into a single derived class. This allows the derived class to exhibit behavior and possess attributes from multiple sources, providing flexibility and code reuse."

    "Answer- Delegation is a design pattern and concept in object-oriented programming where an object forwards or delegates responsibility for a particular task or behavior to another object. Instead of implementing the behavior itself, the delegating object relies on another object, known as the delegate, to perform the task on its behalf.\n",
    "\n",
    "In delegation, the delegating object maintains a reference to the delegate object and invokes methods on the delegate to accomplish specific actions or obtain information. The delegate object is responsible for handling the delegated task and providing the necessary implementation.\n",
    "\n",
    "The key idea behind delegation is to separate responsibilities and promote code reuse by allowing objects to collaborate and share functionality without tightly coupling them together. By delegating tasks, an object can focus on its core responsibilities while relying on other specialized objects to handle specific aspects of its functionality."

    "Answer- Pseudoprivate attributes are also useful in larger frameworks or tools, both to avoid introducing new method names that might accidentally hide definitions elsewhere in the class tree and to reduce the chance of internal methods being replaced by names defined lower in the tree. If a method is intended for use only within a class that may be mixed into other classes, the double underscore prefix ensures that the method won't interfere with other names in the tree, especially in multiple-inheritance scenarios\n",
