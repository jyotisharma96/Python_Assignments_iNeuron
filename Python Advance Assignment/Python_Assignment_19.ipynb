    "Answer- The relationship between a class and its instances can be described as a one-to-many partnership. A class serves as a blueprint or template that defines the common attributes and behaviors of its instances. It defines the structure and behavior that all instances of the class should have.\n",

This means that the class defines the common characteristics and behavior shared by all instances, while each instance can have its own specific values for instance variables.\n",
    "\n",
    "The relationship between a class and its instances can also be viewed as a hierarchical relationship, where the class is at a higher level of abstraction, and the instances are at a lower level. The class provides the blueprint for creating instances, and each instance is an individual object with its own set of attributes and behaviors."

The method should return the result of the addition operation.\n",

Similar to _add_, the _radd_ method should return the result of the addition operation.\n",

    "Answer- A reflection method, also known as introspection or metaprogramming, allows a program to examine and modify its own structure and behavior at runtime. It is necessary to use reflection methods when you need to dynamically inspect or manipulate the attributes, methods, or structure of objects or classes.\n",
    "\n",
    "Reflection methods are particularly useful in scenarios such as:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Runtime type checking: You can use reflection to check the type of an object or determine if it implements specific interfaces or inherits from certain classes.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",

    "3. Frameworks and libraries: Reflection is often used in frameworks and libraries to provide extensibility and customization. Developers can use reflection to discover and interact with classes, methods, and properties provided by the framework.\n",

    "However, not all situations require reflection methods. In many cases, static typing and explicit coding can provide better performance, readability, and maintainability. Reflection introduces additional complexity and can have performance overhead compared to direct method calls or property access. Therefore, if you know the specific structure or behavior of objects or classes in advance and don't need to dynamically inspect or modify them, reflection may not be necessary."
