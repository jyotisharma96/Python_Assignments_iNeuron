    "Answer- When comparing different figures on the same graph, there are several choices you can consider to increase the comparison and make the distinctions more pronounced:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Adjust the scaling or limits: Modify the scaling or limits of the graph axes to better highlight the differences between the figures. You can manually set the minimum and maximum values of the axes to emphasize variations in the data. This can be achieved using functions like plt.xlim() and plt.ylim() in Matplotlib.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Use different colors or markers: Assign distinct colors or markers to each figure to make them visually distinguishable. By using a color palette with contrasting colors or a combination of solid and dashed lines, you can enhance the visibility of individual figures within the graph. Matplotlib provides various customization options for colors and markers.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "3. Add labels or annotations: Include labels or annotations for each figure to provide additional information and aid in identification. You can label the figures directly on the graph using functions like plt.text() in Matplotlib, or you can add a legend to the graph to associate labels with specific figures.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "4. Adjust line styles or widths: Vary the line styles or widths of the figures to differentiate them visually. For example, you can use thicker lines or dashed lines for certain figures to make them stand out from others. Matplotlib offers options to customize line styles and widths.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "5. Utilize subplots or multiple axes: If the figures are complex or have different scales, consider using subplots or multiple axes within a single graph. This allows you to present each figure separately or with its own scale, facilitating direct comparison.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "6. Normalize the data: If the figures have different scales or ranges, you can normalize the data to a common scale for fairer comparisons. This can be done by dividing the values by the maximum or using techniques like z-score normalization. Normalizing the data can help align the figures and emphasize their relative differences.\n",

It displays the frequency or count of observations falling into different predefined intervals or \"bins\" along the x-axis, with the height of each bar indicating the number of observations within that bin.\n",
