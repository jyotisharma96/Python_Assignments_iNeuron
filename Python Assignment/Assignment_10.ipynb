    "Answer- Shutil module provides a funciton called as shutil.rmtree() which deletes a directory and all its contents. The other functions with similar functionality are os.remove() -> removes a file, os.rmdir() removes a empty directory. The problem with these functions is once a file is deleted. it will be lost permanently, if a file is deleted accidentally using these methods there is no way we can recover the deleted file\n",
    "\n",
    "Where as send2trash module provides a function called send2trash.send2trash() to delete a file/directory. these methods moves the files/directories to trash folder instead of permanently deleting them. hence if a file/folder is deleted accidentally it can be still recovered from trash folder, if is deleted using the send2trash.send2trash() function. send2trash is not included with python standard libary like os & shutil modules. it needs to be installed explicitly using the command !pip install send2trash"
