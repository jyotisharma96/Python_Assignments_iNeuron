    "Answer- No, the Python Standard Library is separate from PyInputPlus. The Python Standard Library is a collection of modules that are included with the Python programming language distribution. It provides a wide range of functionality for tasks such as file I/O, networking, data manipulation, web development, and more.\n",
    "\n",
    "On the other hand, PyInputPlus is not part of the Python Standard Library. It is an external library or package that provides additional features and utilities for user input handling in Python. PyInputPlus aims to simplify and enhance the process of taking user input by providing functions and classes with built-in validation, retry mechanisms, and various input options.\n",

    "To use PyInputPlus in your Python code, you need to install it separately using a package manager such as pip."

    "Answer- The import statement import pyinputplus as pypi is a common practice when importing PyInputPlus. However, it is important to note that the choice of the alias (pypi in this case) is arbitrary and can be any valid identifier.\n",
    "\n",
    "The purpose of importing PyInputPlus with an alias is to provide a shorter and more convenient name to refer to the module throughout the code. This can be particularly useful when the module name is long or when there is a possibility of naming conflicts with other modules or variables in the code.\n",
    "\n",
    "By using an alias, such as pypi, you can then access the functions and classes provided by PyInputPlus using the shortened name, making the code more readable and concise. For example, instead of writing pyinputplus.inputStr(), you can write pypi.inputStr()."
