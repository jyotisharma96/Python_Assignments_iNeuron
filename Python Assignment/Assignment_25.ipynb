The __iter__() method returns the iterator object itself, and the __next__() method returns the next element from the iterator. When there are no more elements to return, the __next__() method raises the StopIteration exception.\n",
    "Iterators allow you to iterate over a sequence of elements one at a time, without storing the entire sequence in memory. They provide a memory-efficient and lazy way to access elements sequentially. Iterators are used implicitly in for loops, and you can create your own iterators by implementing the iterator protocol."

    "1. Map calls: Suppose we have a function and we want to compute this function for different values in a single line of code . This is where map() function plays its role. map() function returns a map object(which is an iterator) of the results after applying the given function to each item of a given iterable (list, tuple etc.) \n",
    "\n",
    "        If we already have a function defined, it is often good to use map For example, map(sum, myLists) is more neat than [sum(x) for x in myLists]. You gain the elegance of not having to make up a dummy variable (e.g. sum(x) for x... or sum(_) for _... or sum(readableName) for readableName...) which you have to type twice, just to iterate.\n",

    "    no alternate for it in map\n",
    "    3. List comprehension are used when a list of results is required, where as map only returns a map object and does \n",
    "    not return any list.\n",
    "    4. List comprehension is faster than map when we need to evaluate expressions that are too long or complicated \n",
